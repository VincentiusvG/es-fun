# Es-fun, functional javascript

## Functional development patterns

When programming in an OO language, all problems are addressed with classes, often even the most simple of problems.
The problem with classes is that it often creates a lot of complexity and noise and most design patterns distracts us from the problem our code tries to resolve.

When doing functional programming, the options for solving a problem are limited
and thus enforcing the developer to always use best practices.

The solution for almost all your problems can be solved by:

1. Keeping your functions pure whenever possible.
2. Abstract all the thinsgs in functions.
3. Divide your logical options in a union type.
4. Use pattern matching.
5. Curry your functions and piping them together for function compositions

For developers with limited or no knowledge of functional programming, these concepts seem difficult. In reality functional programming requires a little practice and results in clear and better maintainable code.

Javascript already excels in using functions for abstraction and your functions can be pure, althoug  there is no way to enforce or encourage this. Es-fun is trying to provide a simple way to use the last three patterns.

### The goal of my es-fun library
The main goal of this library is to add functional programming patterns to javascript. For me the main goal in developing this library is get more in depth knowledge and experience with these functional patterns. When final it is to be used for experiments in my other hobby projects. This is for now not targeted to be a serious library for any production development.

## Union types
*I realy shoud create documentation for this.*

## Pattern matching
*working on this*

## Currying
*I realy shoud create documentation for this.*

## Piping
*I realy shoud create documentation for this.*
